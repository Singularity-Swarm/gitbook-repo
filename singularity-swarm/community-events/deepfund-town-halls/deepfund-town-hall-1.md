DeepFunding Town Hall #1 Transcription

Felix  0:03 &#x20;

Awesome, there we go.  Happy happy happy Wednesday everybody many awesome and lovely souls here. For kicking off the very first deep funds townhome just initiated by that most of us most of you know us already from the Catalyst Swarm, in Project Catalyst on Cardano . And we started to build up in the in the last year that Singularity Swarm as well. So pretty much duplicating and replicating what we do in Catalyst for SingularityNet ecosystem. Specific focus on Project Deepfunding from where Jan Harlings you will explain everything what it is about later. And from our perspective from Singularity Swarm, as you know already, what Catalyst Swarm is doing, it's pretty much the same, really providing spaces and environments where people come together to collaborate, to share ideas, to listen to each other, build awareness of each other. And then the best case then, yeah, having awesome collaborations, which then help the ecosystem and the community to move forward in a really healthy atmosphere and culture. Because when it comes to ecosystem comes to the society, which lives in this ecosystem, and the society is determined by its culture, the culture is you guys. The culture is peer to peer interaction, right? And therefore we have this events and sessions and workshops and meetings, where we have quite too many now I would say some calls and Google meet and Discord calls, I think more than in real life actually. So we definitely have to figure out a way how we can stabilize this a little bit. But however,

\


and yeah, project the funds to give it a really short overview and into it as most of you know what Project Catalyst is already. And project the funds, I would say from own experience and perspective by engaging there since beginning of this year, something like a Catalyst 1.0, which also has a look on catalyst, looks down and says, Okay, what are the guys they're doing, how our processes systems, whatnot is working, and how to develop a similar process, but definitely not will one by one copy/paste, but making very specific and unique then for building up the SingularityNet Ecosystem. And SingularityNet is like Cardano, just in AI. So decentralized AI on the Cardano blockchain powered by SingularityNet. And this was initially built on Etherium and is migrating since last year, I think, to Cardano. It's creation is, pretty much on 95 persons happened, done already. And yeah, therefore it's really important great to have a bunch of Cardano, builders, enthusiasts and visionaires here, whatever may happen in SingularityNet, definitely need to appreciate your help and engagement there. And with this, I shut up and handed over to Jan who is the Dor Garbash, most of you know this name already, from early Catalyst day. He was the architect behind Catalyst. And Jan, He is the DeepFunding, I would say architecture mind and moving this whole thing forward and with this Jan, you have a lot to say and to introduce and to present. So.

\


David  36:46 &#x20;

I think it's great. I think we're all excited to hear more.

\


Jan Harlings  37:06 &#x20;

happy chatting, chatting along. Alright, then I'll just continue. I didn't practice this actually, this presentation beforehand. So I have no idea how long it would take me. I thought it would take me half an hour for the whole presentation. But

\


Felix  37:24 &#x20;

Now, we are half an hour on the first point, there we go!

\


Zoe  46:22 &#x20;

Yeah, I have a question. Thank you. Hey, I wanted to ask whether deep funding also funds, the spin offs?&#x20;

\


Okay, thank you so much.

\


Jan Harlings  47:29 &#x20;

Any other questions? Good question, by the way, thank you.

\


Felix  48:02 &#x20;

Looks good.&#x20;

\


So that looks good. That's perfect.&#x20;

\


lets us have a really good question. Any questions? As Curtis had a really nice one. Curtis, you want to go for it? Rather than the in the chat?

\


Jan Harlings  1:11:32 &#x20;

This this slide on screen because that might be the most interesting one.

\


Curtis  1:11:37 &#x20;

It was the differences between like the new project indicator and the projects in ideation phase, and Felix did respond clearly with that. So now I understand the differences there.

\


Jan Harlings  1:11:50 &#x20;

Okay, yeah, well, maybe. So my experience with Zoom meetings is that sometimes the most interesting communications are being held in the chat, which is fine for the people attending, but it's a missed opportunity for the people who are watching it later. So I'm completely open to do this in the open so everybody can learn a bit from it.

\


Felix  1:12:14 &#x20;

The question was from Curtis, is it that new projects are all new projects and in other four Pools. I was wondering is the difference between between new and new projects in ideation phase. So I assume it is just a tech for new projects. But I understand that the main difference for new projects is let's say you have a project, you have already a team, you have done already some foundational work, you know pretty well, what you want to do and you want to come in here, ideation project is much more you have totally completely new idea. Not yet a team, not yet really a roadmap, but you want to go for it. And then the ideation phase pool this might be then the spot to go for you to first find collaborators hiring out the roadmap, milestones, whatnot, and then maybe coming the next funding round. When your project is done, well established already. And then for apply for serious funds for example.

\


Jan Harlings  1:13:14 &#x20;

Yeah, no, that's totally correct. So we saw also in round one, there are people with ideas, but not completely articulated. And what you also see a lot is that people have good ideas, but they are not necessarily AI developers, or it could even be aI developers that are not necessarily have UX skills. And they may not be a complete team at that time. So I think I expect this would be a perfect way to try and collect interest for your proposal and get to other team members involved. But it would also be possible just to create some, get some budgets. And then for instance, letting somebody else on a work or wherever do marketing research for you as a one off, that would also be proper use. But at the end of Pool C should be clear deliverables. That should be milestones and deliverables. This is what we want to achieve. Just just saying, I want to have 5k Because I have a great ideas won't cut it at the ends. You the outcome should be a proposal that will be submitted in the next rounds. Curtis.

\


Curtis  1:14:34 &#x20;

Sorry, I keep popping in but you did briefly talk about essentially voting against a project and I do find that to be valuable information to the proposer as well, but I am curious how we can avoid things that happened similar to Catalyst where whales would come in and actually downvote some of these proposals and that outweighed the positive responses that they got. So I'm just curious what types of mechanisms or strategies are gonna get used to avoid those types of issues?

\


Jan Harlings  1:15:07 &#x20;

Very good question. And we have some ideas about that. We are progressing in that direction. But we'll also some time for us and our community to mature there. And then would love to get in there. But that's all what that is what the next section is all about, actually. So that would be more like, the governance principles. But it's, it's a topic that is close to my heart. And yeah, I really am searching and looking exploring to find the best way to keep the both keep the community alive. Rewarding people that do constructive things. And at the same time, keeping it open and fresh and not make sure that only the oldies gets rewards and not the new people. And of course, trying to minimize the impacts of gaming, the system that we're all I think we should be open that there can always be some kind of gaming, and that that's the nature of the game in a sense. And better as long as it doesn't influence the final outcome, or doesn't have a decisive influence on the outcome. It's not necessarily a terrible thing. Anyone else?

\


Felix  1:16:35 &#x20;

Curtis mentioned already, Kevin Chan, you had your hand up for a second?&#x20;

\


Jan Harlings  1:16:48 &#x20;

All right. All right. Thanks, Kevin. In that case, I see David with a hand up.

\


David  1:16:54 &#x20;

Because do you know when the next round is planned for?

\


Jan Harlings  1:17:00 &#x20;

Yes, now it is open, we have round two, which is open for submission right now. So it will be open at least till 15th of January. We're having a poll now. If you to Christmas holiday, we should keep it open a little bit longer. So if you have a good idea for proposal day fits, you still have a couple of weeks, at least time to submit it.

\


So roughly, the idea in the back of our head is that four times a year would be a good rhythm for the funding rounds. Having said that, all kinds of things might happen. And I'll give you an example. And that's also a good example to understand. So we're about learning rights and rules should be there to help the process and not for the sake of themselves. So I can imagine that if this new surfaces, Pool, Pool B would be a great success. Or if we see a lot of potential for it, that we will separate it from the next DeepFunding rounds and do it with a cycle of its own. And I can imagine we won't want to do that every three months. But if there are a sufficient amount of proposals, we will do it every month. And then we have a DeepFunding round every three months, months, but we have in between maybe two rounds for new services, something like that could happen. Also, I mentioned that in round one, we had two pools. In round two, we have five books now I have to be honest, there. D and E were already valid ways of using those pools, but we integrated them with other pools and having separated ensures that they get more visibility, but also that we can limit the amounts more properly. By the way, oh one thing I forgot to mention a and b are connected vessels. So should there not be enough proposals for round D? We will use the remaining budget for pool a if there are enough proposals in pool a and vice versa. Yeah. I forgot the show. I have two hands now. Kevin on the rebounds.

\


Kevin  1:19:57 &#x20;

Okay, yeah, I've actually another quite session is about the duration. So, like in this, so when you submit, in the submission period, and then when you get feedback, would you be able Are you able to make modifications to your proposal, or do you have to wait on to the stable period to do so,

\


Jan Harlings  1:20:20 &#x20;

No, change as much as you want as often as you want. The learning processes, not just for us, but also for the proposers, we, we architected this whole design. So we could also say you have three days or a week time for answering proposals, but the whole idea is to try and to have a period where you can engage with the community. And of course, engagement only makes sense, if you learn from it and do something with it. So by all means, adapt your proposal. And also during the two weeks stable point, period, you can still adapt it. But then afterwards, the one week, where we look at eligibility and put it at the portal, it's really frozen, then you're also not going to change it anymore. Because otherwise people wouldn't be wouldn't know what they're voting for.

\


Kevin  1:21:09 &#x20;

So there's no like constraint. So even if I submit it, I can still edit it on the

\


Jan Harlings  1:21:15 &#x20;

nose wave portal. There was one smart guy in the last round that submitted an empty proposal. And maybe I shouldn't putting be putting any ideas in somebody's head here. But he thought, well, I can just last day, submit an empty proposal, and then I still have two weeks to fill it. Now, I thought this person had made a mistake, or it was just a test. So I threw it away. And then he told me, but I want to do something with it. And I said, Sorry, pal. But that was not the idea. Anyway, so bad luck. So I feel at this stage. So at some point, as we mature, as the funding will get more and more of those edge cases, and we can describe what we want to do with these edge cases. But in the meantime, I feel pretty free to use common sense and and do it in the spirit make decisions in the spirit of DeepFunding, and be completely transparent in what I did when I did it and why I did it. But suppose that somebody would be clever and submit 10 proposals with three sentences, then I would say this is not in the spirit of DeepFunding and Sorry, pal, but I'm taking taking them out something like that. Alrighty, two more. Hands. I hope that this answered your question.

\


Kevin  1:22:40 &#x20;

Yeah, it did make you cool.

\


Jan Harlings  1:22:44 &#x20;

Our own Felix!

\


Felix  1:22:46 &#x20;

And then for everybody who starts already about thinking of submitting a proposal, we're definitely encouraged and motivated to do so because in the first week of January, we will definitely come back with a second tone, and really have the sense that like we usually are to our phones, we will have breakout rooms really short main room, directly breakout rooms, where you are then able to present your project or your idea to the community as well. And to get some feedback that you will still have some time then to adjust your proposal. So for what's already on the platform, and all announcements done for a second Town Hall will be made in the beginning of January. And you're very much welcome then to present your rough ideas, projects, get feedback, improve it and get clarity then from others as well.

\


Jan Harlings  1:23:33 &#x20;

Yeah, I know we can turn tables and it can be you people talking instead of me talking all the time. There will be great. Thanks for that addition, Felix already looking forward to that next round. And thanks for organizing that and all the effort you're putting into it. Really appreciate it. You know that? Victor. Hi.

\


Victor  1:23:58 &#x20;

Hi, everyone. My question is regarding funding because there is a major difference between Catalyst and DeepFunding. We know that and Catalyst proposers receive the funds on a monthly basis as a function of the total funding of the proposal and the planned time of execution of the proposal as well. While I guess that indeed funding, it's only at the end, and if the community approved proposal, or this at least I think this was like this in the first one. So

\


Felix  1:33:04 &#x20;

Usually a question that is very often okay, what next? What should I do? I think simply as answer there is definitely a sign up on the sign in the platform already. I put the link again here and in the live chat.

\


Jan Harlings  1:33:22 &#x20;

If you're wanting to propose to submit a proposal, I would urge you to go to DeepFunding.AI our websites and go to the rules section and read it from top to bottom, you will hear a lot of what I sat here and more than I told here, it's my always my intention to keep the rules as small as possible. But somehow these things tend to grow anyhow. But I hope it's clear and readable for everybody. So I would if you want to submit it, we'll do that first. And then go to the portal and submit. If you want to read the proposals, you can go to the portal, you can just read up you can see what it did there is already without any login whatsoever. And if you want to engage in I hope you will, then you can sign up. And the preferred method will be to do that with web three wallets. Unfortunately, right now, that's only Metamask. So only Ethereum based. But there are also other ways if you do it with regular login, there's a way for you to on your profile, add your Cardano address. And then we can use that also to connect with the voting portal and to give you tokens or tokens on the reputation and the incentive rewards are based on ADA by the way, AGIX on ADA. Right still two more questions. Zoe.

\


Zoe  1:35:01 &#x20;

yeah, um, you maybe answered a part of it. Just now. I wanted to ask whether, yeah, whether the rewards are Cardano Native Assets or ERC 20 or whether that's even choosable?

\


Jan Harlings  1:35:49 &#x20;

Okay, I thought you had your hand up and down. But so that is the reason why all rewards and all incentives, but also the budgets for the proposal are all in AGIX on Cardano. Last question, perhaps Kevin?

\


Kevin  1:36:12 &#x20;

Yeah, I just wanted to follow up on that. So there isn't really any value to hold AGIX tokens on ERC 20 anymore, right. Since when, like, for example, when you're voting and when you're receiving, like, funding, etc. They're all done through Cardano. So if you have AGIX tokens on ERC 20, then that that will not be included when you're voting right?

\


Jan Harlings  1:36:37 &#x20;

Yeah, sure, it will be included. So we are multi chain, so you can use them on both ends. So right now, if you want to pay for with tokens on our marketplace, the marketplace has not yet fully ported to Cordana you will still need to use AGIX on ether. But that will will change. And yeah, we will become the idea is to become multi blockchain fully. So our voting portal will also accept both wallets basically.&#x20;

\


And there's some tricky technicalities there, but at this, this hour, I won't go into that anymore. And we'll leave that for next time. Okay. All right. Thank you all. I loved presenting all this, I always love to tell about SingularityNet also about DeepFunding. My whole family is usually bored after three sentences and always happy to see an enthusiastic community like this one. So thanks a lot for joining this. And I'm very glad glad to have such a great community of interested people. And I hope to see a lot more of you in the next times. Also, you people out there that are not here live, but hopefully, will be watching this recording. So thanks a lot, everybody. And hope to be seeing you soon.

\


Felix  1:38:15 &#x20;

Awesome. Thanks, everyone. Great week ahead. Take care of yourself. Stay healthy. Don't stay too much in front of the screen, Definitely. And Jan, really happy to see you around in one  or another place.&#x20;

\


Jan Harlings  3:43 &#x20;

thank you, Felix. Yeah, maybe you could say I'm the Catalyst behind DeepFunding. But of course, I know about Catalyst. And we looked at Catalyst for DeepFunding. And actually initially, we had the idea of also onboarding with SingularityNet on Catalyst. But there were some reasons not to do it. And we can go into that in more more in depth later. But besides all the functional reasons I could imagine, one reason is also that DeepFunding is also very much about experimenting. And that is perhaps the part that I like most about it. So we are now in the second round of DeepFunding. And there's already so much different than in the first rounds. And we had a governance round in between things that we didn't even think about when we started. And so it will be very interesting to see where this journey will lead us and where we are a year from now or two years from now. And it's experimenting not just to improve the processes of deep funding, but also experimenting improving everything around Decentralized Governance at SingularityNet, just like Cardano. You know, I think a lot of people here are from Cardano. But I don't think it's a necessity to be from Cardano to be here. Not to require pre requirements or prerequisites, I should say. Decentralized Governance is important. And we also are using DeepFunding to get experience with the, with Decentralized Governance in a number of ways. And we hope we will be able to use that on an even wider scale than just DeepFunding. But that just as a spontaneous reaction to what you were saying, Felix, and thanks for that wonderful introduction. But also, thanks a lot for taking this initiative. Collecting all these wonderful people here already in the first version of this town hall here together, and I feel Yeah, privileged and honored and plain happy to be able to explain everything. Well, maybe not everything, but because there's a lot out there. But a lot about the funding and also about SingularityNet. So this is already a sizable group. Still, I would, I'm perfectly fine with keeping this session as dynamic as is practically possible. So I don't mind being interrupted. Actually, I hope that it will be a dynamic discussion, and not just me talking. So if you have any questions, just let me know. I just was mentioning before the camera was on that I'm really bad at at multitasking. So don't expect me to talk and read at the same time. Even listening and reading is hard for me as a as a male individual. So yeah, feel free to put up your hands or maybe even to interrupt if you want. And if that's getting too annoying, I will let you know. So I did make a few slides, partly for you to read, so you have a better grip on what is being said. And partly for me not to become too distracted and deviated. But stay on course. If that is is necessary, but as mentioned, we can also deviate should that be wanted? Actually, that would be great. Let me share my screen. If there are any already any questions upfront?Oh, wait a minutes.. should I leave it like this, or shall I put it on on slideshow. I'll just leave it like this. If that's okay with you guys, or let me just enlarge my other screen on moments. So DeepFunding, I'll just go ahead. DeepFunding is an initiative by SingularityNet program by SingularityNet. And SingularityNet is all about AGI artificial general intelligence, and trying to be beneficial to the worlds. For an agenda, I thought about these four topics. So I thought it might be good to give you a little bit of explanation on SingularityNet. And what we're doing what we're all about are also a lot of spin offs, as we call them. Then I can tell you a little bit about the background of DeepFunding. So why did we start it what is the purpose then there will be some details on DeepFunding round two which we wish we are currently in. So that round has opened. And then if you if you would like it, we can have some further discussions. And I can tell you a little bit about the process that we are currently experimenting with and deploying and on that whole governance part that I was already mentioning. Alrighty, let me see. Is there already an important question coming up? I see some things in my screen. Now. I think I can safely ignore all that. All right. So if if there's any requests on an other topic, or if you would like me to emphasize a certain topic, on behalf of another topic, or in inspite of another topic then let me know. Cool. SingularityNet. Let me see,just make my screen a little bit smaller. So yes,&#x20;

\


Felix  10:43 &#x20;

before you start Jan, I lose connection the point, sorry. And we'll present several points. And after each point there will be directly q\&a as well, where everybody can address questions. If you have some time.

\


Jan Harlings  10:58 &#x20;

Yeah, we'll make a short pause after each of these points. So if there are things in the chat, I can read them and go through it. If there are any immediate things, don't hesitate to put up your hand or just to say something. And we'll see how it goes. So SingularityNet. The mission of SingularityNet, I'll just read it aloud is the creation of a decentralized and democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence. That's quite a mouthful. But what we're basically trying to do, you know, I have said it a lot of times, in our organization, there is no lack of ambition anywhere in SingularityNet, you will never, ever propose any idea and somebody will tell you, Jan, this is way too ambitious. No, that won't happen, people reach for the moon at SingularityNet. And probably the most ambitious thing that we could try to achieve is creating artificial general intelligence. That's a huge goal in itself, you could say it's the last invention that we as humanity needs to make, because once we have intelligence that is equal to ourselves, then obviously, it won't take long before we have an intelligence that is much more intelligence than we are. And so whatever we could invent, we can have that intelligence invented for us. Obviously, that is also a risky thing to develop. And the purpose of SingularityNet is to make it less risky, and to try to maximize the odds that any artificial general intelligence that we are developing, will be beneficial to human kinds. And we think we have a better shot at that than, say, a country, whether it's China or Russia, or the US, or a big corporates, whether it's the big four, or a Chinese company, or whatever. Because a lot of those AI is developed in those contexts will be after maximizing money, maximizing your attention span, doing stuff with spying or weaponry or whatever. And it's very hard to see how that will trigger a general intelligence that is beneficial for humanity. So what we try to do is to create, not only to create artificial general intelligence, but also to make it accessible to everyone. And we do that through our decentralized AI platform. Actually, that is one of the ways I'll say a little bit more about our technology stack later on. But the idea is that by having by making AGI accessible to everyone, first of all it can create can get inputs from everyone and everywhere and not just from a niche like a corporate or whatever. So it will get inputs from you, me and everyone the good and the bad, but hopefully mostly the good. And that will build that AGI and form it. Much like I would say or as Ben says Ben Goertzel Dr. Ben Goertzel, our CEO, educating or how do you call it raising a child. That's the way we should look at AGI because once we have AGI will be extremely hard to control and people are thinking about it but I don't think you can seriously control and intelligence that at some point will be 1000 times as intelligent as you are. So the best off we have would be to raise it and to infuse it with our own norms and values that we think are beneficial, and then hope for the best. So that's what we're aiming to do. So that's AGI on our platform. And all AI services on our platform are literally available for everybody to add, but also to consume. So that is the way we want to make it democratic and inclusive. So our strategy of doing that, yeah, go a little bit more in the in the in the tech stack a little bit later. But we have a decentralized AI platform that is up and running today. And anybody can add their AI service there. We also have a marketplace on top of the platform. So the platform is really a protocol. And it's aimed at mainly the transactional layer, do trustless transactions between the an AI supplier and an AI consumer in the marketplace on top of that is curated by us. So anybody could put any service on the platform, but the ones that are on the platform on the marketplace should be aligned to our mission and our vision and our values. So what we are doing, what we are offering today is have that service, anybody can put the service there and can start monetizing that service, and any front end application, which might also be interested so especially to the folks from Cardano can use services on the platform by using already software that we already prepared like SDKs, etc. And then creating a business model based on the API calls created by that are consumed from that service. That is that is that is the platform in a simplest way. And that is already quite interesting. Where it gets a lot more interesting. And what we're working on today are is what we call AI, DSL and AI DSL is our AI domain specific language meaning a language designed to have these individual AI services collaborate and cooperate together. And that AI is our you should see it as a an AI in itself that has sufficient intelligence to create workflows between services with the purpose of having a executing a bigger goal than any single services could do. And you can imagine that then you have very small surfaces that are clustered in bigger surfaces that are clustered in bigger surfaces. And all this will be dynamically done on the fly. So whenever there is a new surface emerging or surface with better attributes like cheaper, more reliable rival faster, or better quality output, or whatever you want, or better reputation, actually. It could be exchanged and the AI DSL could make a new configuration on the fly. And you can imagine that should you have not the current 75 surfaces that we have on our platform, but something like say 50,000 surfaces on our plate on that platform. And aiatsl will be continuously working on orchestrating these individual surfaces, that could already be a way for artificial general intelligence to emerge spontaneously from all these AI services. So that's when it gets really interesting. And we're on our way getting there right now, another approach for AGI would be opencog Hyper on and I think you can see opencog Hyper on is somewhat similar but more like a concerted approach. So where we have dedicated AI surfaces, neuro symbolic AI and evolutionary AI, attention allocation, NLP machine learning etc. And we have a language called meta which we constructed ourselves and we have a knowledge base, the meta graph as we call it, where you can store all kinds of knowledge but also relations between that knowledge and you can update that knowledge continuously. And then when you have all these AI services that will be a Both to communicate so orchestrate with each other. And with the knowledge base, by helped by are supported by our dedicated language, that will be a more targeted approach to create AGI. And in the next months or health years, we hope to see the first alpha release of the whole new. So the whole new stack of opencog Hyper on so opencog Already goes 10 or 1230 years back 14, I don't know something like that. And there are some expectation that with hyper own, which is a new iteration on opencog, which is much more scalable and decentralized and also easier to use. The hope is it will have a similar effect as CPU and GPU explosion had on machine learning. So the logic was already there, but because computing is much more accessible, and there's a lot more of it, that gave a big explosion in what we call narrow AI services and machine learning. So that is opencog Hyper on. And yeah, in contrast to current, Chet GPT and those kinds of AIS opencog Hyper on would be have would have the advantage, not only incorporating that part of AI as well as the structure, but also applying neuro symbolic AI. So being more contextual, having contextual understanding of what is being represented, and learning system by the atomspace, which is very, very scalable knowledge database where another database really matter graph. And by adapting that Knowledge Graph continuously, and by doing that, with these multiple surfaces, yeah, the system will be able to learn from what it's what it's experienced, if I can, can use that word. So yeah, we're all terribly excited to see what will happen in the next year. Last year was we did a lot of groundwork there, including the development of meta, which is now in a state that we can actually starting to use it. And yeah, we're also hoping that with this state, we can also attract more users and testers from outside of our organization working on that. So all of that is terribly interesting. And oh, last bullet here, and we're only at the first slide, it should really speed up. I'd be able to tell everything. But I hope it's interesting. If not, then you can also raise your hand. Hyper cycle is actually I was just being scared there for a moment, but it's a thumbs up not a race hat. So thank you. Hyper cycle is our initiative of side chain, or as we would like to call it the side playing chain plus plus working on Cardano. And the technology of hyper cycle is different. It's actually not literally a blockchain since it's Lateralus. It's a ledger of protocol. Or as you could say it as I heard Ben saying, it's a ledger scales all the way down to 211. single note, and it is infinitely scalable. And what hyper cycle will be would enable us to do if it is in production, is you can imagine regenerate. I talked about all the surfaces on our AI platform. And imagine that by aiatsl, all the surfaces start talking to each other. And there are numerous front end solutions that are getting API calls to one surface. That is an API gives an API call to another service that has an API call to five other serves. Well, you can imagine that that could be an explosion, and literally an explosion of API calls going on. And that is what we are actively preparing for. And we are doing that also with hyper cycle and hyper cycle would actually be able, even with those trillions of API calls to to capture all that in a blockchain like trustless way with different levels of security. I won't go too much into that because it will take too long and also because I'm not a big As expert there, it's quite a technical project. But I'm very, very, very interesting to see that coming that from the ground and I think that will also be, it won't be purely for AGI it will be very helpful for our purposes. But it will also be a general use very fast scalable blockchain also with reputation built in. Few those are. So those are the four ways the four main ways I would say that we are trying to achieve Artificial General Intelligence. Also, maybe equally important, in a sense are our values, and we try to be open, we value creativity. We lost collaboration, just like all of you do, otherwise, you wouldn't be here right now. And we believe in being kind, very simple. That's a simple thing. But it's, it's terribly important. And I hope with these values, we will also be able to raise and educate an AI and an AGI and potentially an ASI, a artificial super intelligence that will live by the same values and norms that we have. So that will be our purpose of tomorrow, no, three slides about singularity net sorry for that, I'll go a little bit faster. Unless you really enjoy it, but so we have singularity NET Foundation. But singularity net at this point is also kind of incubator for what we call spin offs. And these are kinds of startups. And we are creating these startups. Because we think they can disrupt the market in a in a beneficial way. Each of these startups is a is a universe of its own with sometimes very huge depths and what they're doing, but also because they're all in a way important elements in the wider ecosystem that we think we need to raise and educate AGI and create a beneficial future for us all. So reduce is about longevity. Mind Plex is a media platform that will be decentralized and open and unbiased, we hope or not not biased in the wrong way. Awakening health is about healthcare and robotics in healthcare. So we do a lot with robotics also with Sophia Tao. Sophia is a very good example of educating and raising an AGI because in the Sophia verse is, that will be a Metaverse which will which will be targeted at that. And that idea that a lot of people will be able to interact with Sophia until she is sufficiently intelligent and independent, and she will be an entity completely over own without any guardrails, so to speak, new nets, I'm hopeful that you will know them. They're also a very like hyper cycle. They're a very important part in our stack in this in the sense that they are doing decentralized computing. And then that is also being applied right now to some Cardano nodes. Because how can you be decentralized if all your computing nodes are hosted on Amazon, for instance. So I think new net is also a very important element in our combined ecosystem. Cogito is creating not stable coins but something called tracer coins. It's kind of stable coin that is not backed to USD or an other currency because that would still make it unstable in a sense, so we peg it to other things and make it or not really peg and we let it follow other indexes and that way hopefully make it more independence. Hyper cycle I told you about to AGI is leveraging AGI for the enterprise world. I'm missing a few here gem galaxy will be the next decentralized Spotify and singularity Dow is an other spin off that is already on the market. Maybe you know them it's all about Defy. One more slide and then I'll ask if there are any questions. So this is a bit of a graphic presentation. Maybe this is a good moment to make it a little bit Bigger up women's that was not what I meant.

\


So this is a graphic a diagram to show our technology stack, the technology stack of singularity net. We started at the bottom one thing we're working on right now with an organization called stimuli is creating a dedicated boards for AGI related computations. And on top of that will be a general decentralized computing in which these board could be used at some places. From unit as I just explained, So, unit will have some intelligence to couple specific computing requests to specific machines. And some might be very GPU or CPU intensive, while others may be less but require a big bandwidth, etc. And there's a market for demand and supply and everybody can create their own metadata and say what they want and not want to have done on their computer. So that's decentralized computer Cardano does, it rings a bell, but I have a hard time explaining it right now. And it's the greatest blockchain project out there, of course, which is very important to us also, because of Plutus, Haskell integration computable outcomes, that's a very important ingredient also for us and for for AGI of the of the future. And also doing transactional computing with with a lot of security and reliability. So there's a very good reason why we consider ourselves to be a very good partner of Cardano. So all you Cardano guys and girls here, we definitely love you. We're still also on Aetherium. So we aim to be multi blockchain, we won't leave Aetherium. And then there's a hype cycle as a layer on Cardano, not on Aetherium. But as a level two layer on Cardano, making these trillions of transactions possible. And then we have the platform. So these little cog wheels here will detect the individual surfaces surface can be very small, okay, very big. And I imagined and that opencog hyperlink would be a larger server that will be in the surface that will be in the middle of all these smaller servers. And would could be connected, both in the inputs and the outputs. Without services that goes a little bit too far to explain in detail. One more thing that I would like to mention here about this decentralized AI platform is the way I see that involved, see it evolve, once AI DSL is completely up and functional. Is that right? Now you will need to create a surface with the kind of end goal. But if you have a lot of surface on platform, then you have a kind of micro architecture of surfaces. And that will enable any surface supplier not to create a very elaborate surface, but maybe make a very small surface that does, this just does a very simple thing. But does it very good, very fast, very reliable and very cheap. And if you can do that, then maybe 20,000 Other services will be rather using your service for their functions than trying to do this by themselves. And all the while the reputation of that small service will increase in increase, which means that more people will be using it. And I see this as a future economy as an economy of AI services where there are continuously transactions going on. And just like in the real economy, there will be very niche players doing very specific things. And there will be surfaces that are very generic and very complex, doing very complex stuff. And one of them will be opencog hybrid. So yeah, I hope I can plant that image in your mind of an AI economy of all the surfaces working together in AI publishers and developers being able to specialize themselves in a certain type of service. And then, as I mentioned, we have all these startups and spin offs around our core, our core stack, and they are all important parts of our ecosystem for business reasons and the word disruption was already mentioned earlier in this call And a lot of them have a clear capability to disrupt the market. They're in Review for the health market and Gen Galaxy for the musical and entertainment market, and so on and so on. But at the same time, they're also referenced cases they show and we'll show how projects can leverage our platform and the surfaces on our platform. And besides that, we'll be creating surfaces on them for by themselves, and also publish them on the platform. Pool. And one thing left to say on these things, we have been creating the spin offs and the startups. But to make the bridge to deep funding. The idea of the funding is that the funding can take over. So we will continue to see a stream of new startups being built, but in that is being funded not by the Foundation, but by the DeepFunding wallet. Alright, let me one moment, go through this view, because that was part one. Sorry, go a little bit, but I'm too enthusiastic about this to be short. Are there any questions so far? Or was this either so clear, or so overwhelming that or already so long that you'd rather have me.. Keep talking, then interrupt me with more questions?

\


Cool. Thank you for that, David. Let me just check if there are any, if it can see any questions...

\


Felix  37:02 &#x20;

In the chat? Not so far. Just congratulation chats.

\


Jan Harlings  37:28 &#x20;

Maybe some some next part go and can go a little bit quicker. So the origin of DeepFunding. We started SingularityNet, in 2017 with an ICO. I wasn't working for it back then, but I still say we I was interested in SingularityNet, already at a time, I just missed opportunity to be involved in ICO. And then four years later, five, four or five years later. Our CEO Ben Goertzel said, Well, we meant it's a billion token and our ICO, What would you like our dear community? How would you like the idea? If we would go about and mint another billion tokens. And you can imagine how that was received at first. And at that time, I was also in the community. And of course, people that is the one thing that you don't do in in crypto, of course, diluting the amount by minting new tokens which were not projected in advance. But the arguments were if we do this, we will be able to scale faster, AGI is important the big corps have billions of dollars available. And in order to be able to keep up and to compete with them. It will be great to have some additional means. And I as a community member at that point, I thought well, it would probably be better to have a smaller part of a very big cake, then a bigger part of a very small cake or a cookie. So what we did at that time we put it up to a vote, we asked the community to vote on this. And I really love our community for this because an overwhelming amount like 90% of the people made this crazy decisions of diluting their own token amount by minting another billion tokens. But these tokens were earmarked. It wasn't just tokens to do whatever we want. There were clear guardrails there. So half of it, go to the foundation and 30% of those tokens were allocated to DeepFunding. And these tokens are minted on a monthly basis and actually, in a decreasing amount. So every month, a little bit fewer amount of tokens are being minted, a smaller amount of tokens is being minted. And that way, it will take 91 years before the last token, last complete code token token will be made. So we can continue afterward afterwards with fractions. And the idea behind that is also that, first of all, it's a long term thing. So we're saying to the community, we won't do this again, three years after. But also we believe, we hope that the token value will increase as the token economy on the platform, the AGI economy on the platform that I talked about will, will increase. And that way, we are confident that also, we don't talk about price a lot, because it's really a utility token. But the value of our token will hopefully increase by that utility, and therefore, having decreasing amount might not be the best, the worst thing to happen. So that is where the treasury of the funding comes from. So every month, there are new tokens every month, a little bit less new tokens. And we try to be conservative with with spending those, but not too conservative. So that's basically what is what is mentioned in the slides, and we have the face to foundation proposal, you can still read it back, if you if you like. So the funding itself in general. The most important part that isn't that is what is was set out to be already in the proposal, I think it's mentioned here, "for community development initiatives chosen by democratic process." So that was already more or less set in stone in our DeepFunding proposal. So DeepFunding is a community driven program, aiming to drive the utility of the platform and to seed it with compelling new AI services. I just changed the sentence a couple of hours ago. So it sounds like a mission that was done by an advertising agency and a year ago. But we're still learning, right? So. But the community learning part is extremely important. And eventually, it should be 100% community driven, I hope somehow, we're not there yet. To be honest, it's still quite centrally driven, but we try to engage the company or the community where we can and steer it from where we are now, to a situation where it can be completely handed over to a mature and well functioning community. And how that will look in the future is something that we are exploring and finding out right now all together. And I will talk if I have time left, I will talk about that later and more. So these three points are still very accurate. The goal of DeepFunding is to grow the AI platform. So that is really the goal. And right now we have five pools. I'll talk about that a little bit later. But in basis, all of these tools have the goal to help the AI platform grow and grow and can be done by, for instance, creating new services on the platform. But another way of growing the platform is by utilizing all of the services that are already there. Yeah, community driven, so SingularityNet Foundation, we meet and also Peter here may suggest and advise, I do that reluctantly. But some sometimes I might do that. Or I will do that say and say I really favor this, this this project. But in the end, it is the community that will decide which projects will be awarded. And in a sense, that makes my life much easier because I can speak to all these teams and I can say I love you all. But it's not me who will decide it's the community. Yes, we aim for transparency and scalability, ultimately aiming for a sustainable, sustainable community governed DAO. So that's what was what I was explaining before. And I think right now, If I can be so modest, I would say we do excel in transparency. Sometimes we still decide things a little bit centrally, because we're at the beginning of this DeepFunding phase. And there's so many decisions that need to be made. And we can't have a vote for all of them. So it's a little bit centrally driven sometimes, but we are completely transparent in what decisions we made and why we made them and in detail how we are doing them, you can go to the DeepFunding site, DeepFunding.ai, you can go through our blog post, and you will see also detailed analysis of what happened in the voting with voting rounds and who voted what's more or less and, and what that means and what our considerations are and how we want to adjust and improve that process in the next rounds.Alrighty. See, that was the second part already. A lot faster. Any questions on this part? Well, I'll take a sip of cognac. No, tea. First, Zoe, you have a question? Yeah. Yeah, at least you have your hand up.

\


No, no.

\


Zoe  46:33 &#x20;

Okay.&#x20;

\


Jan Harlings  46:34 &#x20;

No, no. So theoretically, it would be possible, I would say if a spin a spin off is completely independence, that they would also submit a proposal. So there are right now, two spin offs, Nunet and SingularityDAO are completely independent from the Foundation. The others are still in the process of being incubated we want them to be in to be independent also as a different journey to decentralization. But as long as they're being funded by the Foundation, I don't think it's right to also have them being funded by DeepFunding because that because we would like to keep those two parts of the Treasury separated, as much as possible. Not completely, because I'm still paid by the Foundation, for instance, and not by DeepFunding, but.

\


We will, we'll get to the details of round two after so I can I can imagine then it becomes a little bit more actual and concrete. So I wouldn't be surprised if that would also assure a few more questions. So unless there's anything right now. I will continue with the third part of this.

\


Sorry, Felix, you're saying?

\


Peter  48:10 &#x20;

All right. Thank you. So Round two is open. It has started. It's not like catalysts were on the first our 10s of proposals may be hundreds are already pouring in. We are small, and we starting and were modest. But there are a few proposals out there already. What we saw on the first round, by the way, is that I think we also we had a we had around for four weeks open for submitting proposals. And if I remember correctly, health of the proposals were being submitted in the last three days. And I think the total was something like 45 proposals or something for a first round. And actually, we were quite, I was quite happy with it with that amount. So we'll see what happens this time. So the schedule right now this might change, we actually have to have a poll on that. I'm not sure if it's already out Peter, but it will be assumed otherwise. But the idea is right now that we have four weeks for a submission periods, and it will be great if projects, proposals are submitted early in the project, because then the community can start to engage and give feedback and you can use that feedback to improve your proposal. I will tell you about the kinds of proposals later then we will have two weeks where we will freeze the submission per portal. You can't add new proposals anymore, because just as the reason that I that I just mentioned would be very awkward to have a lot of proposals in the last day then the whole community won't have have the opportunity to review and assess them and give proper feedback. So we have a free period for two weeks where the community can just add some ease. Go over these proposals and read them and give feedback when we're interested. Then we have one week where we will prepare our voting portal. And we will also do an eligibility check. That will be a little bit different than last time. Last time, there were, for instance, proposals that, in my opinion, didn't really help the platform. They were great proposals, but it didn't help grow the platform. There are some other rules right now it would be important to be in the right, right pool, for instance. So we'll use that week for that, if we would get 2200 proposals may will take a little bit more than a week, but that's something to be seen. Then it will be voting time and it will be will also be for a week. So by that time, we are somewhere in the first or second week of February that the voting starts. And by that time, our portal will be supporting both AGIX our native token on Ethereum. But also AGIX on Cardano. There's some details between these wallets, etc, that we're still sorting out. But we'll update on on the final rules before the voting will start. Oh, one more thing. I got feedback from a few people, at least one of them in this group that mentioned that the 15th of January was a little bit early with Christmas in between. Now I figured that for some people having Christmas in between will be beneficial because everybody is bored on New Year's Day, etc. So you can perfectly use the time to create a very nice proposal. But there are two groups of people, some people have a day job and do this as a side job for those it might actually be beneficial to have it overlapping with Christmas. But there are also people who are professional and based on their daily work will submit a proposal and then of course, being in Christmas period might be less of an office support. And for a lot of people it's a busy period anyway. Anyhow. So we are preparing I think Peter a poll, where we will ask community and we'll talk it's not official, but just to get an impression. Whether this idea that the 15 is a little bit too early is supported by a lot of people. Should that be the case? We will postpone the whole schedule with two more weeks. We are that flexible DeepFunding.

\


It will be in Discord tonight.&#x20;

\


Jan Harlings  53:05 &#x20;

Sorry, it will be..

\


Peter  53:07 &#x20;

It will be on Discord tonight in the DeepFunding #general.

\


Jan Harlings  53:11 &#x20;

All right. Great, thank you. And then arguably, for some people, maybe the most important slides in this presentation, because here it's about the money. So these amounts are probably not what you're used to in Catalyst. Like I say we're just a small brother. But I think we can really help our platform forward. Also, based on the these amount, the first round actually had $1 million of AGIX available this time, also due to market circumstances. And we because we want to balance the current utility of our token also for DeepFunding and also reserve sufficient for a later moment when we can hopefully do more with the same token. We are a little bit conservative there. But still, I think these days $500,000 worth of AGIX is a fair amount that can do some some some good work for us. So I'll go over these pools, one by one. So we have two main pools. Pool A is the biggest one where $250,000 is allocated. And it's for any project proposal that will as part of the bigger project, either create a new service and put it on the on the platform or utilize a service that is already on the platform or do both which is also possible. And it doesn't have to be only a service it could also include a A front end solution like an app or something, and that could also be part of the whole project that you are building. But there should be a service you utilized on the on the platform. The first round, we had two pools, we split it in two pools with two maximum one with $40k maximum, one with $150k maximum, or are between 40 and under 150k. And that was because that moment in time, on Catalyst, it was still usable, the average proposal is still a very low value proposal. That's I believe that is not the case anymore, I heard of some really big amounts being awarded. And we wanted to have an opportunity to also have a few bigger projects out there. That's why we made that differentiation. Right now we have a smaller pool, but they also think it will be a good experiment to leave that to the community, would you rather have two or three bigger projects, or 15 smaller projects. So in theory, it would be possible to have one project for $250,000 worth of AGIX being awarded and all the rest not. But as mentioned, that is to the discretion and the judgments of the community. The community of token holders that is. The second one is actually an outcome of our governance round where we asked all of the community, "Listen people, do you have any ideas how we can improve the funding round one in round two, not round 3, 4, 5 And forever. But round two." We got quite a few proposals, and one of them was this one, "Why don't we make a specific, dedicated pool for existing AI services." Because obviously, there are already a lot of AI services out there some publicly available but maybe also services created by students or people in their spare time that never found a way to a bigger public. Or that could use a platform like SingularityNet to start monetizing on their surface. And the hope that we have is that with a smaller amount of $125,000, we will still be leveraged be able to leverage a larger amount of services because of the work that needs to be done. So, this pool will be interesting for different roles. So it will be interesting for AI developers, obviously or that already have a service. But it will be also be interesting for community members that want to go out and find service and know services and contact the developer and say, "Hey, would you would you think it's a good idea, shall we make a proposal together, and then submit it and see if we can both benefit from that." So also, the community member in that case can benefit from that. And then finally, for software engineers that might not be that AI verse but are more about Cloud Hosting and those kinds of things and would help an AI developer to onboard their service from the platform that could also be part of that proposal. And on that onboarding, there is more to say we would like to make onboarding easier, we will be working on that in the future in the near future. But one way of doing that is actually not offering it as an automated tool. But creating services around it, as in a human service, I should say, because some AI services out there will be too specific or will be always be things that needs to be done manually. And for that group of services, it will be great to be able to, for an AI developer to outsource that source that kind of work. So if any of you in this call or who are viewing this afterwards will be interested in becoming a preferred supplier of SingularityNet and helping other teams to onboard I think, potentially, you can make a very healthy living off that. So then just contact me. But it could also be done as part of, of this route. So I'm expecting a lot of this route. I really, really, really hope to see a lot of services land, at least a lot of proposals being made and then also services land on our portal. Another difference with we were  targeting smaller proposals here. So what we're saying here is that we will only pay out in this case, when the service has actually landed on the portal. In all the others we have a milestone based approach, not a time based approach. So if you have a proposal, and you you are are awarded and you start working. The basic idea here is and you're doing that in Catalyst right now also for the higher awarded things. But we've started with that. You have to tell me, Jan, I created my milestone, listen, here's the deliverable, you can see it. Now giving you my money. That's basically how it works. There are some more details to it. But But I won't go into that. And I always say that was the best decision I made, because it's ensures that are so much less potential for friction between the DeepFunding people on our ends and the DeepFunding teams. Because if for whatever reason, you need a little bit longer than you expected at the beginning, it's no problem, you can take your time. But it's your time, and you will get funded when you are ready. And when you deliver on a milestone. And I think that works very well for for both ends of the spectrum. Alright, three supporting services, pool, sorry. Pool C was also a direct result of our governance rounds. And actually, here, what what made the pivot what made the final push is the additional voting weights that came from the reputation score gains by contributors on our portal. And if I have time, I would love to tell a little bit more about that, because that is really the governance process that we are after here. So this pool is a small pool, it's a supportive pool for people that have a great idea. But it needs that idea to mature further, before they can apply it to a regular Pool A, I would say in the next date funding rounds. So the goal should always be I have an idea. And I want to submit it in the next DeepFunding rounds. But I need something and that something that can be team members. So you can get some feasibility of your idea, you can also get good feedback on your idea that Google in itself already be very valuable. But it might also be that you want a little bit support to create the technical design or to create a good UX interaction design or something, or do market research that would also be feasible. And then you can get sponsored with I imagine a couple of $1,000 to get over that first threshold. And maybe there's somebody in the community who would like to take on that job. And then that person could get paid by that amount that is supporting, for instance. But it's very experimental. While Pool B had huge support overall by our complete community, Pool C was a little bit more of a mixed bag, and it was the reputation score that finally switch the balance to having it in. So it'll be very interesting to see what what will surface there. And if it's good, we'll keep it and if it's not good, we'll either change it or remove it to lead marketing initiatives. So another way to support the growth of the platform is by marketing by getting more reach by getting attention from both developers or AI consumers on the platform. So if you have a good idea to achieve that, you're very welcome to create a proposal. You don't need to be an AI developer or anything if you're a marketeer. Or just have a have a good idea. You could already do this. The one thing here is that it will be needed to make some kind of KPI driven and measurable. So we're just not not just handing out money for a great idea. Spending 5000 on Google ads, whatever. No, you will get it if you can also show that you you are actually getting results with it. And I'll go right through the last pool. 75,000 is a little bit more sizable because that is reserved for tooling. And a tooling can be either for the platform itself, for instance, to make onboarding easier. It might also be tooling that will help the DeepFunding process and to be very honest here I'm with a few current team members of DeepFunding I'm preparing a proposal I won't be submitting it won't be my proposal, but I will be advising on it. For reputation dashboards. I want to keep track of reputation scores. I'm doing it now in Excel sheet, but that's a sub optimal. And the next phase. So first of all, it will be dedicated to whatever we are doing currently on DT funding. We'd love to spend another half hour talking about that, but sorry. But in the next face, I also want to make this available more generically for the wider ecosystem and the wider crypto sphere out there, including Cardano. If we can have a crypto dashboard, where we can plug in different data in different reputations, sources, and any user of that data could mix and match and who say that is reliable source. And that is reliable source. And I want to use the scores in this in this way to create my own reputation that is relevant for my purposes, I think there would be a great thing to have for the wider decentralized community. So that's a little bit about my personal vision. On this. Just a few screenshots after this, I can also go through the live slides, but in speed, I thought it would be good just to have it out here. So if you go to our website, proposals.DeepFunding.ai, you can also get there through our website. And you go to missions, it's called missions in our this is a portal created by our partner SWAE. And as a lot of cool features that we can already use, including, for instance, a web three login, and including something which I did, especially for us, it's first you had to log in before you could see anything. But now everything is out in the open for everybody. But you can also only start interacting and engaging after you are logged in. So those are just two features that I really appreciate on this platform. They're a small team, they're growing, and we're trying to grow with them and and help them evolve their features in a way that it's also useful for us so that about our partner, but here you see these five, five Missions. Here they are in the in the wrong order. But normally there will be Pool A, Pool B, Pool C, D and E just like I explained. And if you would click on one of them. And this is from our governance round actually, then you would see each individual proposal like a card, as displayed here. And if you would click that, if you think this is an interesting proposal that you would like to learn more about, then you will get a page, like here on the right, with all details of the proposals, it's quite free format, you can basically do there are there are a number of questions laid out already. But you have a lot of freedom and what you want to put there. At the bottom of the page, you have feedback. So feedback is important. And it's divided into three groups or this is core basic existing functionality of our portal provider, you can list your concerns, you can ask for questions, or you can provide strengths that you see. So that's already a nice feature, there's there's still things I think can be improved here. But that's maybe for another session. And then finally, what you can also do, which is also a little bit confusing, you can rate each project so each person can already give their rating. You can also do that anonymously. By the way, you can even propose a submitted proposal anonymously, if you want. That rating is not the same as voting. So voting rating you undo all the time, the voting is in a specific period and you need to have tokens for that rating can be done by everybody. So rating is a first gawk both for the community and for the proposals out there to see how is my proposal received. And actually in the in the community governance rounds, we also use that as part of our reputation system. So going back to the reputation system, in our current first primordial version of reputation you would get in a governance round you will get points for a proposal and the better it's rated the more points you would get. But you will also get points for creating comments feedback, but you will get much more points if your feedback is viewed positively. And if your feedback if you get  negative feedback, it could also give you a negative reputation. So just spamming this, for the sake of quantity is already something that might be tricky. Also, I'm already starting with the governance part. But I think it's easy with the screen. So bear with me for a moment. And then we can have questions and answers on the on the DeepFunding rounds. And I lost my track here. One thing. So it will not be based on KYC or anything, it will be wallet based. So you create an ID based on your wallet, you can also have a traditional login if you want. But that means that everybody knows what wallet XYZ is doing. And you can build a great, great reputation for yourself. But nobody needs to know that there's actually Jan Harlings living in the Netherlands on a certain address. And still, we can connect it with behavior on our voting portal. But more about that in the next session. Few time for me to be quiet and take a sip of my brandy, ah tea.

\


Kevin  1:16:41 &#x20;

Oh, yeah, I think I can save it for later. It's a technical question.

\


David  1:17:26 &#x20;

I do have I'm thinking to propose, but I'm not sure whether to propose in which pool basically. So I guess my question is, do you know when then DeepFunding round three years. So we can for instance, if we're planning to apply to the ideation, the we can kind of plan for runway or or when the next target for funding from DeepFunding we can apply for them.

\


Jan Harlings  1:24:34 &#x20;

You get your friends. Yeah, all at the end of a milestone at the end of a milestone. But so it works like this. You submit a proposal. There's a vote and your awarded then in the back ends, we sign the contracts. Not that special, but at least that we have something official before handing you over and having you started. So on both ends, the agreement is clear. Then in round one, it was the case that we just like in Catalyst, we gave you a starting amount of an at that point, it was $5,000 worth of AGIX for everybody as a fixed amount to get started. And from that moment on, the rule was, you have predefined milestones, that was part of your proposal, it was obligated to have these milestones and these milestones should have a name, they should have a budget related, and they should have an explanation and deliverable. So, for instance, I will have a UX design for my app, and milestone three, or a clickable demo or whatever. So then, I wouldn't chase you. But instead, you would come to me and say, Listen, Jan, I have my clickable demo right now. So you can see it. And based on that I would like to get reimbursed for for that milestone. So in advance, you were in charge in round one in how much you want to, if you want to have big milestones or smaller milestones didn't matter to me, because they were bigger, you just have to wait longer, but you will get more for that milestone. Of course, there's always still a risk that after the eight of 10 milestones, you will still drop out. But at least you've done a lot of work and you've shown commitment, etc. And the whole spirit by the way of DeepFunding is not somewhat not a spirit of policing, we really, really believe in collaborating, and together trying to make the best of your effort and your solution. And not just looking like a civil engineer or whatever at the rules, but also trying to make something cool together. And that's also what we see we have biweekly optional, not not obligated by weekly meetings with the teams. And of course, there are always a few that are always there and a few that you never see there. But the dynamics in those meetings is always always very good and positive and constructive and people reacting to each other and also send out a survey with feedback to the teams and was also really good, actually really positive. So in this round, it's a little bit different, but it's quite, I'll show it's a little bit complex. So first of all, what we what we're doing is to protect our Treasury can sudden downwards movements of the token price, we say, we will take into account the fixed minimum token price. So whatever the real token price is doing, it will never go below that. And we chose we pick that value well below the current value and also below the all year value of our token. So we hope and expect that it will not go below that. But should it go below that, then the funding might be impacted. And if that is the case, we will have a one on one conversation, we'll talk about what is the best solution and what best fit for you. Now, because that might mean that in an in an exceptional situation, you might not get refunded for the total amount that you project it for a milestone, we reverse the order. We are now saying listen, you will get the rewards at the beginning of a milestone. But we still do expect an X number of milestones or reasonable differentiation between your milestones and steps. And we will still disbursed milestone base. But it's just that the order. You won't get the 5k at the beginning, but you will get the payment for the first milestone. And that first milestone should not be 90% of the total funding. I think that makes sense. So that is how it works. And yeah, like I mentioned before that whole milestone thing was the best decision that I ever made on DeepFunding.Any questions?&#x20;

\


Victor  1:29:23 &#x20;

Got it. Thank you.&#x20;

\


Jan Harlings  1:29:25 &#x20;

Cool, cool. All right. It's already turning into a marathon people. Tell me, would you still like to go into the final part about decentralization and governance? Or would you prefer to leave that now and to do that in the next town hall as an isolated thing? Can we organize quick frozen that's I don't know. They put your hand. Put your hands up. If you're saying I would prefer to end it right now. And And to address this properly in next round 123012345 I think that's a sizable and counting six, I think at least half of us here have their hand up. So let's, I think that's a good decision. So I have something in store for next time, I already know to know what more to tell next time, and it will be very interesting. So I hope I will also be seeing all of you back then. So we'll talk next time, about reputation about quadratic voting about voting weights, about.. Well, one thing I want to mention here is that, based on the reputation score that we're creating, we're also handing out rewards. So in our deep governance, community governance rounds, we had 100,000 AGIX that we distributed over all contributors. And because it was a first round, for some people, that was quite a sizable amount that they got for well, relatively little effort, I hope in the next round, there will be more contributors. So it will be more balanced than that. But I hope this will be just an extra incentive, I hope it won't be the only reason but an extra incentive for people for you to come to our portal proposals.DeepFunding.AI, and become engaged. And if you don't create a proposal, but then react and give your honest feedback on proposal and constructive and, and help the people that that that did go through the effort of submitting a proposal because it always takes more effort than you think. To respectfully give them feedback that they can use to make it even even better. And in the process of doing so. Yeah, get some nice rewards for that. And that's as as a as a small nudge for the next time is also one of the ways and maybe the most important way we try to counter that thing of Whales doing negative stuff. But we can talk about it next time. And it would also very much appreciated discussion on that next time, because in the end, it's supposed to be decentralized processes, etc. And there's more than one way of solving this. And I'm also always very much interested in your opinions on the same. Alright, I would say unless you have any questions at this point, that won't take me half an hour to answer because then we don't have a solution.

\


No, it's not choosable. So this is this comes from these rewards are being paid from the the DeepFunding treasury. And DeepFunding treasury was based on the tokens minted in our Phase 2. And what I forgot to tell you, is that the seconds amount of a billion tokens, they were all minted on Cardano as native tokens. Another question, there Zoe?

\


Zoe  1:35:48 &#x20;

No, thank you very much!

\


Kevin  1:37:10 &#x20;

Oh, Okay. Cool. Yeah. Thanks.

\


Jan Harlings  1:38:31 &#x20;

Yeah, also our social DNS, we have Telegram channel we have Discord channel, I have number of Discord channels on DeepFunding and one server on SingularityNet. Welcome to join there and ask any questions and if I am available, if I have any opportunity, then I will answer them or Peter will answer them or anyone else of our community. Right. Thanks a lot. It's a wrap! Thanks, guys. And otherwise, bye.&#x20;
