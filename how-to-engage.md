### DeepFund Roles: How you can become an active participant and builder of project DeepFund and the SingularityNet ecosystem

You can engage in one or multiple roles at the DeepFund and SingularityNet ecosystems and communities, let’s have a look at the current ones.

A brief introduction into some value adding roles at the Community

### The Proposer

Proposers are individuals, groups, companies or communities who submit proposals at project DeepFund to receive funding from the SingularityNet treasury and to build the future of the growing ecosystem. Everyone is allowed and invited to submit proposals on the DeepFund platform as far as submitted proposals align with the vision of SingularityNet&#x20;

### The Feedbacker

Once Proposals are submitted, the community is invited to read and evaluate submitted proposals. Leave your feedback as a comment below the proposals by submitting your feedback in one of the 3 categories which addresses “Concerns”, “Questions” and “Strengths” on the submitted proposals

### The Voter

Once Proposals are finalized and the deadline of submitting proposals has passed, the community casts their vote via an on-chain process to determine which of the submitted proposals should receive funds to implement and execute proposed solutions. Community members can also join a pre-vote on the DeepFund platform to have a say if the submitted proposal should be actioned and be released for the final on-chain vote.

### The Governance Expert

The Governance Experts are a group who hold recurring meetings and who engage in Discord communications to ideate, discuss and align on next steps for Project DeepFund. Meetings are recorded and outcomes are presented as documents to the wider Community. Everyone is welcomed to join the Expert Group and to build strong Experience and Expertise over time by participating and engaging.

### SingularityNet Ambassador program

SingularityNet Ambassadors are highly experienced, engaged and committed community members who help to build engagement and awareness on SingularityNet while exploring and establishing a open and vibrant environment for the community to collaboratively interact at the ecosystem
